TASK 6. Chocolate

A chocolate bar is a rectangle of NxM chocolate bars
The user enters the number of pieces K that he wants to break off in one break.
If the bar is square, the side N is changed.
If the break is possible, the new size of the tile is printed, if not possible - the old size.
If one of the sizes reaches 0, the programme displays the following message
Chocolate is over
message and stops working
The zero size is not displayed
If the user enters a non-positive number, the programme stops with the message You are full.
N, M, K are in the range from 1 to 1000.

TASK 8. Multiples of 6

The user enters a sequence of digits.
After each entered digit, the programme determines
whether this set can be used to make a number divisible by 6
If no - outputs No and the input continues
If yes - outputs Stop and the programme ends.
If the user enters -1, the programme ends

+ - * / % =
The programme is given an integer N1 in the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive,
then the operation sign op1 ,
then the integer N2 again, etc.
The operation priorities are not taken into account in the calculations
It is guaranteed that the last operation in the sequence is = =.
After that the programme should output the answer res
